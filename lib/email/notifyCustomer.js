/**
 * lib/email/notifyCustomer.js
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The single entry point into the email system. Callers — order.js
 * today, the Admin Dashboard's status-update route tomorrow, a
 * background worker after that — all call the exact same function
 * the exact same way. No template or provider logic is ever
 * duplicated between callers.
 *
 * DESIGN NOTES
 *
 * Storage-independent: notifyCustomer(order, statusKey) takes a
 * plain order object, not an ID. It never reads messageStore, a
 * database, or anything else — it has no idea where `order` came
 * from. Whoever calls it is responsible for fetching the order
 * first. This is what lets the eventual Supabase migration change
 * nothing in this file.
 *
 * HTTP-lifecycle-independent: this is a plain async function with
 * no req/res parameters and no assumption about when or how it's
 * invoked. order.js currently awaits it BEFORE sending its HTTP
 * response (running it after the response turned out to be
 * unreliable on Vercel — the execution environment can be frozen
 * before a post-response network call completes, which silently
 * drops the email). Nothing in this file requires any particular
 * order, though — it's just as valid to call this from a queue
 * consumer, a cron job, or a retry worker later; the function's
 * contract (order + status in, { sent, error } out) doesn't change
 * either way. If true background/async execution is introduced
 * later (e.g. a queue, or Vercel's waitUntil()), that logic wraps
 * THIS function from the outside — this file doesn't need to change.
 *
 * Failure-isolated: never throws. Every failure is caught, logged,
 * and returned as { sent: false, error } so a broken email can never
 * take down whatever called it.
